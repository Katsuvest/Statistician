# Qualifications as a Statistician

 ## Statements of Accomplishment

In my pursuit of becoming a **[Statistician](https://github.com/Katsuvest/Statistician/tree/master/Statistician_with_R.pdf)** with a focus on  **[R_Programming](https://github.com/Katsuvest/R_Programming)**, I've completed various courses to build a strong foundation in statistical concepts. 

Courses studied and completed have equipped me with a strong statistical skill set, making me well-prepared to apply advanced statistical methods in various analytical scenarios.

Here's a summary of my completed courses:
